# AsUpIO.sys Privilege Escalation Exploit

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full local privilege escalation exploit leveraging the **AsUpIO.sys** driver, commonly installed by ASUS utilities. The exploit abuses poorly protected IOCTLs exposed by the driver, enabling unprivileged users to:

- Read/write Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
- Allocate and map physical memory
- Read and write physical memory
- Overwrite the CR3 register to redirect the page table base
- Locate and hijack the `System` token from the kernel's `_EPROCESS` list

Author: [@blkph0x](https://github.com/blkph0x)  
Target OS: **Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100+)**

---

## üî• Exploit Features

- ‚úÖ Uses `WRMSR` to overwrite CR3 and control virtual address translation
- ‚úÖ Builds custom page tables to remap kernel memory
- ‚úÖ Uses physical memory read/write to locate and patch EPROCESS
- ‚úÖ Automatically spawns a SYSTEM shell (`cmd.exe`)
- üîí Planned stealth features (anti-debug, PEB patching)
- üß† Modular codebase with multiple memory scanning techniques

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Summary

The ASUS AsUpIO.sys driver exposes the following primitives **without validating caller privileges**:

- Arbitrary MSR read/write
- Contiguous physical memory allocation
- Physical memory mapping via ZwMapViewOfSection
- Unrestricted I/O port access

This allows a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary kernel memory manipulation.

---

## üíª Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires the vulnerable **AsUpIO.sys** driver to be loaded.
>  
> Test in a VM or isolated lab environment.

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile `main.cpp` as a 64-bit Release binary
3. Run on a machine with AsUpIO.sys active (commonly installed by ASUS AI Suite or OEM software)
4. Choose the resolution method when prompted:
   - Scan kernel VA
   - Scan physical memory
   - Use known offsets
   - Walk page tables manually from CR3

### Example
```bash
Asupio_Exploit.exe
[*] Select EPROCESS resolution method:
1) Scan kernel VA...
2) Scan physical RAM...
3) Use known offsets...
4) Walk EPROCESS list from CR3...
```

If successful:
```bash
[+] Found our EPROCESS @ 0x... patching token...
[+] Token stolen! Launching SYSTEM shell...
```

## üìö Internals

### Attack Flow

1. **Device Handle Acquisition**  
   Open a handle to `\\.\AsUpdateio`.

2. **MSR Read**  
   Extract the CR3 register via `RDMSR`.

3. **Page Table Forgery**  
   Allocate physical memory for:
   - PML4, PDPT, PD, PT
   - 1 test page to verify mapping

4. **Construct Virtual Mapping**  
   Forge a page hierarchy that maps a single VA to our test page.

5. **Overwrite CR3**  
   Switch to our custom PML4 with `WRMSR`.

6. **Token Steal**  
   Search for `EPROCESS` structures and hijack the `System` token into the current process.

7. **SYSTEM Shell**  
   Launch an elevated `cmd.exe`.

## üî¨ Research Notes

- `EPROCESS` offsets were verified with WinDbg on Win11 24H2.
- Known token offset: `0x248`, PID offset: `0x1D0`, ActiveLinks: `0x1D8`
- If scanning fails, fallback offsets are applied.
- Page table construction uses `E7` flags for `PTE_FLAGS`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Countermeasures

- Microsoft should revoke the driver signature of AsUpIO.sys versions exposing these primitives.
- End users should uninstall ASUS AI Suite or other utilities installing this driver.

---

## üß™ Tested On

- ‚úÖ Windows 11 24H2 Build 26100 (VM + bare metal)
- ‚ùå Not tested on earlier versions (may require offset updates)
